# kicad-keyboard-parts

A collection of KiCad footprints to make it easier to build keyboards and plates.

## Slots

The goal of the slot footprints library is to be able to create easily-manufacturable top plates for keyboards. The slots are simple
square cutouts with rounded corners so the tooling at PCB fabrication shops can easily route it.

**Note** - These footprints have not been tested yet for fabrication, or for correct fit on actual stabilizers.

## Footprints

To be implemented.
